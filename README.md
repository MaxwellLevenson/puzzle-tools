## General Puzzle Rules
1. Nothing is a coincidence
2. The title is a clue, any words that seem out of place are clues
3. Never should need to brute force
4. Organize information in a spreadsheet
5. When in doubt, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3cN3yR9.jpg" target="_blank">Google</a>
6. Think about the design of the puzzle, if you think a detail was intentional, it is a clue
7. Often one has to convert a derived solution back to the original form of the puzzle, recurse - see [example](https://www.collegepuzzlechallenge.com/Puzzles/ViewPuzzle.ashx?id=1320&view=solution)
